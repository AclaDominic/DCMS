# Railway Frontend Deployment Setup

## âœ… Files Updated for Railway Deployment

I've made the following changes to configure your React+Vite frontend for Railway:

### 1. Updated `fend/package.json`
- Added Railway-compatible preview script
- Added start script for Railway
- Preview now binds to 0.0.0.0 and uses Railway's PORT

### 2. Updated `fend/vite.config.js`
- Added preview configuration for Railway
- Preview host set to 0.0.0.0
- Preview port uses Railway's PORT environment variable

### 3. Created `fend/railway.json`
- Railway deployment configuration
- Uses npm run preview as start command
- Health check on root path

### 4. Created `fend/Procfile`
- Alternative process file for Railway
- Uses npm run preview command

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create Frontend Service in Railway

1. Go to your existing Railway project (where your Laravel backend is)
2. Click "New Service"
3. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your DCMS repository
5. **Set Root Directory to `fend`**
6. Click "Deploy"

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

In your Railway frontend service, add these environment variables:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-railway-url.railway.app/api
VITE_APP_NAME=DCMS
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Replace `your-backend-railway-url` with your actual backend Railway URL!**

### Step 3: Update Backend CORS

In your Railway backend service, update the `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable:

```env
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-railway-url.railway.app
```

**Replace `your-frontend-railway-url` with your actual frontend Railway URL!**

### Step 4: Test Deployment

1. Visit your frontend Railway URL
2. Test login functionality
3. Check browser Network tab for API calls
4. Verify CORS is working

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Railway builds your React app** using `npm run build`
2. **Railway serves the built files** using `npm run preview`
3. **Preview server binds to 0.0.0.0** and Railway's assigned PORT
4. **Frontend makes API calls** to your backend Railway URL
5. **CORS allows cross-origin requests** between Railway services

## ðŸ“‹ Environment Variables Summary

**Frontend Service:**
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` - Points to your backend Railway URL
- `VITE_APP_NAME` - App name
- `VITE_APP_VERSION` - App version
- `NODE_ENV` - Production environment

**Backend Service:**
- `FRONTEND_URL` - Points to your frontend Railway URL (for CORS)

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits

- âœ… Both services on same platform
- âœ… Easier management and monitoring
- âœ… Internal networking between services
- âœ… Shared environment configuration
- âœ… Coordinated deployments

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **Deploy backend first** to get the backend URL
2. **Use the backend URL** in frontend environment variables
3. **Update backend CORS** with frontend URL after frontend deployment
4. **Test thoroughly** after both deployments

Your React+Vite frontend is now ready for Railway deployment!
